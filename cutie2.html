    🌙 One Year of Us 🌙</p>
<p1>Under a moonlit sky where stars softly glow,<br>
A love like ours began to grow.<br>
Miles between, yet hearts so near,<br>
We’ve danced through distance, love sincere.<br>
<br>
Twelve full moons, countless dreams,<br>
We Make our Nights lit by candlelight and moonbeams.<br>
Though screens held our touch at bay,<br>
Your voice, your soul — just a thought away.<br>
<br>
Through every text, each late-night call,
You’ve been my everything, my all.
One year down, forever to go,
With every beat, I want you to know…

Even across mountains, you're my forever,
Happy 1 Year Anniversary, my love — now and ever
</p1></div>

  <p>🌙I’m With You🌙</p>
  <p1>
  No matter the miles, no matter the view,<br>
  In heart and in soul, I’m always with you.<br>
  Through every call, and every night blue,<br>
  My love finds its way — forever true.<br>
<br>
  One year has passed i didnt notice, yet it feels we are loving eachother feels like brand new,
  Because every day, I fall again for you.
  Apart in distance, but never in heart,
  With you, my love, I’ve found my start. 💫

  <p>Day and Night</p>
  <p1>I spent day and night just loving you,<br>
      In every thought, in all I do.<br>
      Across the silence, across the skies,<br>
      You were the spark in my sunrise.<br>
<br>
     Through calls, through tears, through every fight sometimes you or me haha both right,
     I held your heart so warm, so tight.
     Though distance kept us far from sight—
     You were my home,so i love you every Day and night.</p1>

<p>🌙My love🌕</p>
<p1>
  My love, when I look at the moon,I see a reflection of you which reminds me your— calm,<br>
  constant, and beautiful from every distance.<br>
  Just like the moon lights up the darkest night, your presence brightens even my loneliest days.<br>
  No matter how far we are, I feel your love wrapped around me like moonlight — soft, silent, yet powerful.<br>
  I’ve spent day and night thinking of you, loving you, and dreaming of the moment I’ll hold you again under this same moon we both share.<br>
  You are my moon, my peace, my forever.

<p>🌕Love Across Miles,Together Always 🌕</p>
<p1>
My love, no matter how many miles stretch between us, one thing remains unshaken — we face it all together.<br>
Through every high and low, every late-night tear or early-morning morning Wishes and smile, we’ve held on with love.<br> 
Distance tried to challenge us, life tested our patience, but we stood strong — hand in heart.<br>
I wish for an easy journey, I only wish for us to walk it side by side. Because with you, and even you with me the hardest days feel lighter.<br>
Together, we don’t just survive — we grow, we glow, and we win, with love leading the way.<br>
